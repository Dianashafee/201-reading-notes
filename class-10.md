# Reading Assignment 10
## JAVASCRIPT AND JQUERY Chapter 10: "Error Handling and Debugging" (pp 449-486)
- Order of Execution
  - Not always as obvious as it seems
  - Functions that call a second+ function have to activate again once that function is finished
- Executions Contexts
  - One of three: global, function, and eval contexts (eval not shown)
    - roughly corresponds with global vs local variables
- THE STACK
  - First in, last out
- - Two phases that occur upon entering a new context
    - Preparation - new scope created, variables, functions, and arguments created
    - Execution - values assigned to variables, reference functions and run their code, execute statements
    - Hoisting - functions and variables can be called and get values before they're declared
      - This is because variables and functions are created within an execution context before being executed
        - Execution contexts create variable objects, which contain all the variables, functions, and parameters for that context
    - Each execution context can access its parents variables
  - Functions in javascript have lexical scope - they are linked to the object they were defined within
    - Therefore, the scope for each execution context is the contexts variables object + parents'
  - Looking up the stack can affect performance. Further = more effect.
  - Variable objects can't be accessed. Behind the scenes.
- Understanding errors
  - Javascript will stop when it encounters an error.
    - Better to inform the user than just stop, so we need error messages
      - We need to handle the error
    - Errors create error objects
      - Browsers can help read these
      - Seven types of built-in error objects
        - Syntax
        - Reference
        - Type
        - Range
- How to deal with errors - 2 options
  - Debug scripts to fix
    - Workflow: 
      - Where is the problem? 
        - Look at the error message
        - Check how far the script is running
        - Use breakpoints to check variable values
        - Talk out what is happening to other engineers, vs what should be happening.
      - What exactly is the problem?
        - See if variable values are what you expect
        - Break out pieces of code and test their functionality
        - Check for numbers of parameters in a function, or values in an array
        - Write down notes of what you tested and what the result was
  - Handle errors gracefully
    - Can use try, catch, throw, and finally statements
      - try - runs code. If exception, go to catch. Then do finally.
    - Make sure to handle edge-cases from third parties
- Use browser dev tools
  - console.log
    - also console.info(), .warn(), .error(), .group()/.groupend(), .table(), .assert()
  - Breakpoints
  - Step through
  - Debugger keyword
  - Can create our own error with throw
- Debugger tips
  - Try another browser
  - Add numbers
  - strip back the code
  - explain the code
  - search online
  - use sandbox
  - use validation tools
- Common errors
  - capitalization, missed var, reserved words, variable out of scope...
  - missed/extra characters
  - data type issues
