# Reading Assignment 5
##  HTML AND CSS Chapter 5: "Images" (pp 94-125)
- Images can set the tone of a site faster than a description
- Stock images are available
  - www.istockphoto.com, getty images, veer, sxc.hu, fotolia
  - Can't just take photos from another website
- Should use images on a simple, consistent background
- Should keep images in a separate folder called images
  - Might want subfolders on a big site
    - ie interface, products, news, etc
  - Content management software sometimes handles images for you
- `<img src="<img address>" alt="<img description>" title="<mouseover text>"`
  - `Also has height and width parameters
- Images in code
  - Before a paragraph: paragraph will begin on new line after image
  - Inside the start of a paragraph: first row of text will align with bottom of image
  - In the middle of a paragraph: between the words of the paragraph it appears in
- Old: Aligning images
  - align - exists in html, but CSS should be used instead
    - in case we see in older code:
      - left or right - horizontal
      - top, middle, or bottom
        - Where first line of text will start relative to image
- Three rules for creating images:
  - Save images in the right format
    - jpeg, gif, or png
      - jpeg for different colors
      - gif for same color (ie logos)
  - Save images at the right size
    - Same size that they will appear on your site
  - Always measure images in pixels
    - 300 DPI or higher
- Should only crop images so that you won't lose valuable information
  - Vector images can be scaled up
- Made up of lines between points
  - Usually bitmap versions have to be saved
    - SVG images are actually vector, are becoming more common
- Gif images can show animations
  - Slower to load, should be used carefully
- Transparency in images
  - Can retain transparency as gif if edges are straight and transparency is 100%
    - Otherwise, transparency requires saving as a PNG
      - Not fully supported in older browsers
- Tools to edit and save images
  - photoshop
- Should check sizes of images
- `<figure>` allows images and captions to stay together
- `<figcaption>` allows caption to be added to image

## HTML AND CSS Chapter 11: "Color" (pp 246 263)
- color property can be specified by RGB, hex code, or color names
- background-color is specified the same way
  - default on browsers is white, but users can override this
    - So if background color is important, it should be set specifically
- Colors have hue (color on rainbow), saturation (amount of gray), and brightness (amount of black)
- Contrast
  - Foreground and background colors should have enough contrast for text to be legible
    - Low contrast is a problem for the visually impaired, colorblind, poor monitors, and sunlight on screens (on mobile outdoors)
    - Medium is better than high contrast for long spans of text
- Opacity (CSS3) (alpha)
  - Need backup color for older browsers
- HSL colors (CSS3)
  - Can specify colors with hue, saturation, and lightness
  - HSLA (A=alpha) also possible in CSS3
## HTML AND CSS Chapter 12: "Text" (pp 264-299)
- Typeface terms:
  - Serif - little details on ends of letters - considered easier to read in print
  - Sans-serif - straight ends to letters - cleaner design
  - monospace - each letter same space - easier to follow in code
  - Weight: light medium bold black - increasing emphasis and contrast
  - Style
    - Normal
    - Italic - cursive aspect
    - Oblique - Normal just angled
  - Stretch
    - Condensed - narrow, tall letters
    - Regular
    - Extended - long, flat letters
- Choosing a typeface
  - Not all browsers have all fonts
    - Font stack - specified order of preference
  - Browsers are supposed to have at least one font of each of these types (font families):
    - Serif, Sans-serif, Monospace, Cursive, Fantasy
  - Techniques for more typefaces:
    - Font-family (see above, usually at least one of each in every browser)
    - Font-face - fonts from other places
      - fontsquirrel, fontex, openfontlibrary
    - Service-based font-face - paid custom fonts
      - typekit, kernest, fontspring
    - Images
    - Sifr - flash movie font
    - Cufon - uses javascript to make SVG version of text
  - Type size
    - Units: px, percent (of 16px), em (ratio to size of letter m), pt (old standard from printed text)
  - Bold (normal or bold)
  - italic (normal, italic, oblique)
  - text-transform(uppercase, lowercase, and capitalize)
  - text-decoration (underline and strike)
  - line-height (leading) (space between lines)
  - letter-spacing, word-spacing
  - text-align (left, right, center, or justify)
  - vertical-align (often confused, aligns relative to in-line items
  - text-indent
  - text-shadow (CSS3) (dark version of text just behind and offset)
  - :first-letter, :first-line - independently styles these psuedo-elements
  - :link, :visited - independently styles these psuedo-classes
  - :hover, :active, :focused - styles for user-interactible psuedo-classes.
- Attribute Selectors
  - Existence [] matches a specific attribute
  - Equality [-] matches a specific attribute with a specific value
  - Space [~=] matches a specific attribute whose value appears on a space-separated list of words
  - Prefix [^=] matches a specific attribute whose value begins with a specific string
  - Substring [*=] Matches a specific attribute whose value contains a specific substring
  - Suffix [$-] Matches a specific attribute whose value ends with a specific string
