# Reading Assignment 4
## HTML AND CSS Chapter 4: "Links" (pp 74-93)
- Links use `<a>` (anchor)
  - href attribute specifies where to go
    -Ex: `<a href="http://www.google.com">`
  - Link text should be clear where the link is going
- Links can be relative or absolute
- Directories on websites work the same, can store files
- Index.html is default homepage
  - Browsers will navigate here if given the generic domain name
- Page and directory paths are called URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)
- Email links use `href="mailto:<email address>"`
- Links can open in a new window with target attribute (_blank)
  - Inform users before opening link in new window - good practice
- `href=#<id>`can link to specific part of same page with the id
  - Can link to specific part of another page with `href=<URL> #<id>`
