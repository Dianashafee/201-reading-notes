## Article: The Past, Present, and Future of Local Storage for Web Applications
- Persistent local storage is easier on native client applications than web applications.
- Cookies exist, but they have three huge downsides:
  - Included with every http request, slowing things down by transmitting the same data over and over
  - Unencrypted
  - Limited to about 4KB of data
- We really want:
  - Lots of storage space
  - On the client
  - persists beyond a page refresh
  - isn't transmitted to the server
- Some "hacks" existed before html 5:
  - Internet explorer had userData, up to 64KB of data per domain
  - Adobe Flash 6 "cookies" allowed 100KB per domain
    - With Flash 8, could access flash objects easily with javascript
  - Google Gears allowed unlimited SQL data storage via API
- HTML 5 set out to create a real solution
  - "HTML storage", "Local storage", "DOM storage"
  - Before using, should check browser supports it with short scripts
  - key/value pairs
    - key is a string, value can be any javascript type (but it is stored as strings)
  - localStorage.getItem(), localStorage.setItem(), clear(), removeItem()
    - square bracket syntax ok
  - Can iterate through keys by index
  - Can track changes with "storage" event
    - Occurs when setItem, removeItem, or clear are called and actually change something
  - Supported in all browsers
- Limitations of HTML 5 storage
  - 5MB of storage by default
    - Will get QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR if exceeded
    - Cannot ask user for more html storage as of 2011
- Can save game states every time a change is made
  - Can call resumeGame() function on page load, instead of newGame()
- Again, all data is in strings
- Competing visions for data storage
  - WebSQL (?)
