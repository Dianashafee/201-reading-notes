- How Websites are Created
  - What you see
    - Browser is receiving HTML and CSS from a web server, which it interprets.
    - Images, audio, video, and animations can also be inserted in a page.
    - Some sites also have Javascript and Flash for advanced functionality.
  - How it is created
    - Small websites might use just HTML and CSS
    - Larger websites that update regularly might use a content management system, blogging tools, e-commerce, etc. which require more complex technology, but even those technologies are still producing HTML and CSS.
      - These sites might have a database to store data, or use another language such as PHP, ASP.net, Java, or Ruby on the web server.
        - Do not need to know these to improve what the user sees, and the contents of these books should be enough.
  - HTML5 and CSS3
    - HTML and CSS have had several versions.
    - At time of writing, HTML5 and CSS3 were still being developed.
      - Book includes features from these new versions.
    - Knowing new versions gives you the ability to understand old versions.
- How the Web Works
  - To find a website, your browser connects to DNS server which finds the location of the web server hosting the requested site.
  - Connection happens first to ISP, then to DNS servers which provide the 12-digit IP address, then to web server denoted by the IP, and the web server sends the site to your browser.
