      - Ex: everyone waits their turn to talk, always start meetings with chit-chat, etc.
      - Still struggled to find patterns
- 2008: CMU, MIT, and Union College recruited 699 people to find "group IQ"
  - Found that the teams that did well at one task did well at all of them
    - And that teams that failed at a task, tended to fail all of them
  - Found a pattern: in good teams, everyone talks roughly the same amount
    - Further, teams did well when the members had high "average social sensitivity", or awareness of others' emotions
      - Do well at Reading the Mind in the Eyes test.
    - Good teams have "psychological safety":
      - a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking
      - a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up
      - describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves
      - Good teams also had clear goals and a culture of dependability
        - But psychological safety was most important
